# CollegeInflationTest
Uses preset values for yearly college costs.

These preset values include tuition, rent, and salary. To find the total cost of 4 years in college, the program uses separate tax rates on all preset values to find the total cost. It then considers excess and how much in debt or extra a student will have. The tax rates and preset values can be changed manually within the code, not with a scanner.
